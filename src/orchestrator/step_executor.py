"""
Step-level execution with parallel players and debate.

This module implements the core logic for executing a single plan step:
1. Spawn multiple players (based on topology)
2. Each player executes the task in parallel
3. Players debate (critique and revise) their results
4. A synthesizer consolidates the final result

Uses the unified ExecutionContext abstraction for all data access.

The execution flow is:
    execute_parallel → critique → revise → [loop or synthesize]
