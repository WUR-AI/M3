        PLAYER_CONFIGS["data_analyst"],
        name="analyst_1"
    )
    
    # Execute a task with ExecutionContext (used internally by orchestrator)
    result = player.execute_task(
        task="Analyze dataset structure",
        context_key="ctx_abc123",  # Key to registered ExecutionContext
        context_info={"name": "my_dataset", "resources": ["users"], ...},
        workspace={},
